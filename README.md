# MTX to PBBS Converter

- Wrote a basic MTX to PBBS graph format converter since I didn't find one online. MTX refers to the [Matrix Market File Format](https://networkrepository.com/mtx-matrix-market-format.html) and PBBS referes to the [Adjacency graph format from the Problem Based Benchmark Suite](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pbbs/publications.html).
- Note: Not very fast (usually takes a couple of seconds to process a graph with millions of edges).
